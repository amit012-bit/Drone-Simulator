# Drone Simulator

## Description
This project is a Drone Simulator web application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). It allows users to simulate the motion of a drone on Google Maps based on user-provided latitude and longitude data. Users can input time-series data or upload a file with the entire time-series information. The application plots the drone's path on the map and provides functionality to pause/resume the simulation.

## Features
- Display world maps using Google Maps API.
- Input latitude and longitude data manually or upload a file.
- Simulate drone motion on the map based on user-provided data.
- Pause and resume the simulation.
- Error handling for saving and fetching drone data.
- Bonus tasks: Ability to add multiple paths and simulate multiple drones in parallel.
